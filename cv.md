# About Me
Frontend Developer wannabe and creative person with 10+ experience in Design and Communication. I’d describe myself as a goal-oriented, self-motivated and hardworking person. In my previous work experience I’ve developed a number of soft skills, such as decision-making, problem-solving and multitasking. In the work of a developer, I like that you can create real things.
Now I am looking for opportunities to kick off my tech carrier.
